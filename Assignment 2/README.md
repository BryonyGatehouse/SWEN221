# Assignment 2 : Tetris

Aim of Assignment is to debug the classic game of "Tetris", originally developed by Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov

Part 1 - Simple Moves
    Check game correctly recognises all the simple moves that a piece can make. Write additional tests to ensure system is working correctly.

Part 2 - Landings
    Implement the mechanism for landing pieces. Confirm your code passes the tests.

Part 3 - Invalid Moves
    Check game correctly recognises when a move is invalid. For example, a piece cannot be moved off the side of the board. Likewise, a piece cannot be dropped below the bottom of the board,or into the middle of another piece. Write additional tests to ensure the system is working correctly.

Part 4 - Line Removal
    Correctly handle line removal rows when a tetromino has been 'landed'. All rows that are full must be removed and the rows above moved down. Ensure all tests are passing.
