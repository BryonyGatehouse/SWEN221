PICTURE PUZZLE

Aim of assignment is to debug a simple program which implements
a "Sliding Picture Puzzle". 

Part 1 - Small Boards
    Check that game correctly implements simple moves on small 
    (ie. 2x2) boards (ignoring rotation). Find defect in Location 
    class and fix

Part 2 - Big Boards
    Check the game correctly implements simple moves on larger
    (ie. 3x3) boards (ignoring rotation). Find several defects in
    Board and Move classes to fix

Part 3 - Rotation Moves
    Implement the rotation move in the game. A tricky algorithm

Part 4 - Game Over
    Implement the test to determine when the game is over. This
    requires changes to the Board class
