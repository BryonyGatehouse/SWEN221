# Assignment 1 : Picture Puzzle

Aim of assignment is to debug a simple program which implements a "Sliding Picture Puzzle". 

Part 1 - Small Boards
    Check that game correctly implements simple moves on small (ie. 2x2) boards (ignoring rotation). Fix the code so that the tests pass.

Part 2 - Big Boards
    Check the game correctly implements simple moves on larger (ie. 3x3) boards (ignoring rotation). Create your own tests to find the bugs and fix the code.

Part 3 - Rotation Moves
    Implement the rotation move in the game. This is a trickly alogorithm which requires lateral thinking.

Part 4 - Game Over
    Implement the test to determine when the game is over. Create your own tests and edit the existing code to solve the problem.
