SETTLERS OF CATAN

Part 1 - HexNode
  -   Complete the Implementation of HexNode
      -   A node cannot have itself as a neighbour
      -   If going WEST from node1 we reach node2, then going EAST 
      from node2 we reach node1. That is, the graph is 
      non-directional: if node1 is connected to node2, then node2 is 
      connected to node1 in the opposite direction.
      -   If going EAST from node1 we reach node2, and going NORTHEAST
      from node1 we reach node3, then going SOUTHEAST from node3 we 
      reach node2.
      -   the method HexNode.isValid() contains useful assertions 
      checking that the graph is valid ac- cording to those criteria.
      We encourage you to use isValid() or a similar personalized 
      method to check if your code is preserving the validity of the 
      graph.
  -   stream() and clockwiseStream() allows to stream the nodes

Part 2
  -   toString() prints out the information of the graph in a board
  shape
  -   setResources() takes pool of resources and distributes them left
  to right, top to bottom over the board
  -   getResourceCounters() takes pool of resource counters and 
  distributes them on the board in a clockwise fashion. DESERT tiles
  are given a count with value NONE
  -   distributeResources() given a dice roll, distributes any
  resources gained to players that have settlements on tiles with
  that number
