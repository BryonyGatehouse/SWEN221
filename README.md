# Software Development

This course develops a deeper understanding of object- oriented programming and associated practices. The focus is on programming techniques at the micro scale. Topics include: inheritance, polymorphism, genericity, error handling, testing and debugging. A sequence of short assignments will develop the key ideas and practices; rigour in testing will be developed through (automated) assessment of programme correctness.

### Course Learning Objectives

Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Implement, test, and debug object-oriented programs using all the facilities of the Java programming language, including exceptions, generics, assertions, and concurrency.
2. Appreciate the range of programming techniques available, the strengths and weaknesses of particular techniques, and be able to choose and apply an appropriate programming technique to a given problem.
3. Understand the range of programming tools available, their different strengths and weaknesses, and be able to choose the appropriate tools for a software development task.
4. Use appropriate programming tools, such as development environments, test harnesses, frameworks, and libraries.
